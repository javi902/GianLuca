You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump
In four months you're brought to life
And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin
Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why
